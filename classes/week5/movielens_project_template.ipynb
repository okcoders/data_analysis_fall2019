    "**Directions**: *we will be doing an analysis of the MovieLens dataset. Your analysis will be a combination of markdown text explaining what you are doing as well as the code and output conducting the analysis. You will see italics instructions throughout different cells here, but in each case I would like you to re-write the questions in your own words as you build your analysis. A person looking at your analysis should be able to read the text part only similarly to how they would an article or write-up. But, embedded with your analysis will be the code used to run all parts of it. The inclusion of plots in this analysis is entirely up to you and how you prefer to make your point.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: it is not necessary to follow every aspect of this rubric perfectly. I am more interested in you being expressive and showing off the completeness of your analytic abilties--both in code and communication. The ability to answer some of these questions may very well depend on you consulting the documentation and learning how to use slightly new tools that while they are similar to the ones we have worked on so far, may not literally be any of the ones we went over in class. Please use the time in class to make sure you have a good plan to do the individual things you need to, and feel free to ask us for help in coming up with that plan or figuring out how to use any new functionality you may need."
